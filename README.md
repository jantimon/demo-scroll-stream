# Demo about web loading strategies

In this demonstration, I explore the effects of Client-Side Rendering (CSR), Server-Side Rendering (SSR), Streaming, and React Server Components on key web performance metrics such as Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) and Interactivity. 

This demo also serves as a playground to experiment with CSS-only scroll animations.
